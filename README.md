## ü§î Technology Choices

I selected Fastify as the primary framework for several reasons:

1. **Performance**: Fastify is one of the fastest web frameworks for Node.js, offering low overhead and high throughput
2. **TypeScript Support**: Excellent native TypeScript support which enhances development experience and code quality
3. **Modern Architecture**: While Express.js is still widely used, Fastify offers a more modern approach with better performance and developer experience
4. **Team Alignment**: The technology stack was chosen to align with the existing team's expertise and preferences
5. **Ecosystem**: Fastify has a rich plugin ecosystem that simplifies implementing common features like caching, validation, and more

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

While this project currently focuses on fetching cryptocurrency pair prices, several enhancements could be implemented:


1. **Historical Data** - Add endpoints for historical price data and charts
2. **WebSocket Support** - Real-time price updates
3. **Multiple Exchange Support** - Aggregate prices from various exchanges
4. **Advanced Caching** - Redis integration for distributed caching
5. **Monitoring** - Add health checks and performance monitoring
